      <h2>Pros - What are the advantages of driving a fully-electric vehicle?</h2>
      <p>More and more places have dedicated <b>Parking</b> for electric vehicles now. The spots are wider too so less likely to get door dings!<br> 
      <a href="https://ibb.co/jzk2VK3"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/qCYf0Gm/parking.png" alt="parking" border="0"></a>
      <br>No more oil changes or worrying about transmission or radiator fluid. The only <b>Maintenance</b> you really have to do is changing the cabin air filter and windshield washer fluid. Regenerative braking also extends the life of your brake pads.<br>

         <h2>What is Regenerative Braking? <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/cars/shopping-guides/what-is-regenerative-braking" alt="brake"> Click for article</a></h2>
      </article>
      <p id = "testP" class="funParagraph">Electric vehicles have <b>Performance Benefits</b> over gas vehicles. An electric motor is able to give the EV instantaneous torque, which leads to strong and smooth acceleration. It feels like you're in a roller coaster!</p>
      <br>Everytime we come home we plug in the charger which means <b>NO MORE getting gas!</b> So the only time I go to QT now is when I want some tea!</p>

      <h3>Cons - What are the disadvantages of driving an electric vehicle?</h3>
      <p><b>Driving Range</b> goes down faster on EVs especially if you have a heavy foot or just using your A/C.<br>
      <br>You can charge your car with a regular wall outlet like the one you use to charge your phone but <b>Battery charge time</b> will literally take 1 to 2 days if you are below 20%. Investing in installing a level 2 charger will help dramatically.
      <a href="https://ibb.co/7zJD3kp"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/vBxWNXd/charge.jpg" alt="charge" border="0"></a><br>
      Tesla has continued to increase charging stations but still <b>Limited Charging Infrastructure</b> compared to traditional gas stations. If you plan on taking your EV on a roadtrip prepare to plan the trip around charging stations.<br>
      <br>Under warranty batteries are covered till 100,00 miles or below after that expect to pay around &#36;10,000 - &#36;20,000 for a <b>Battery replacement cost.</b></p>
